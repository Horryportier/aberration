# [[Software]]
---------------------

## Game Engine
Bevy or Godot or Love2d
- Love2d
    Simple but to mutch stuff is not buildin mening using maybe 3party libs or doing it myself.
    Which would not be that bad but I'm  planinig on delivering at least semi playable expirance. 
- Godot 
    Great for 2d has bunch of tools for visual stuff but,
    getting data from one part of game to other can be tricky  #skill_issue
- Bevy 
    still changing and in early stages yet it has many tools and community. 
    Also entity system feels nice. But will have to deal with long compile times 
    I can do other stuff in meanwhile  like art.


## Art
- Libresprite
    if i go for pixel art style
- Krita
    if i don't go for pixel art style
- Other
	tiled for tile-maps


## Music
idk
